# rgb-space-rocks-from-space

Started off as the Game Maker tutorial game [Space Rocks](https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/space-rocks-gml), but I did some tinkering. Firstly I made the bullets a random color when fired by just passing 3 `random(255)` values to `make_colour_rgb()` (resulting in rainbow bullets. PAINBOW.), and then did the same for the asteroids.
It looked pretty cool so I showed my wife and her suggestion was to make it so asteroids could only be destroyed by bullets of the same color. Challenge accepted and completed! Pressing "Shift" changes your player sprite and bullet colors, making it pretty challenging to dodge space rocks *and* shoot the right color bullets at the right color rocks. I even added separate scores for each space rock color (which was surprisingly fun to figure out as someone who had zero experience with GML).

Don't really plan to return to this game since it's just a tutorial project, but still wanted to throw it up on github so I had to to refer back to later if needed.
